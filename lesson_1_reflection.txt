How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Quickly highlighted the differences between the versions, and thus the bug that was introduced.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Easy/possible to revert back to old versions without having to manually editing out changes.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Can make logical units of changes in each context, but prone to human error.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Coding projects usually require multiple files and a logical change often
     requires changing multiple files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Find the commit id with log and then diff the corresponding ids to view the changes

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Can easily revert back to a previous working version of the code

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    To manage the cerebral fix project properly
